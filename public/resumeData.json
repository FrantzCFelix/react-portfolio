    "bio": "I am a Front End Web Developer with an education background in Computer Science and Animation.  I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Washington, where I developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. An innovative problem solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development. My degrees in Computer Science and Animation have given me a unique user focused approach to solving problems, where I focus on the astheitc working as smoothly as the back-end. With each project, I aim to understand how to best engage users for an impactful user experience. I applied agile development in a recent project where I worked in a team of 4 to develop a single-page MERN app that helps local artists/producers find new talent, seek it out and chat with one another. When I’m not designing or developing, I enjoy getting outdoors music festivals, hiking, backpacking, and camping are my go-tos! I also enjoy indoor bouldering, I have only been doing it for a year but have gotten rather good at it! If i'm not being active I’m hanging out with friends, 3D modeling, 3D printing, or playing video games! Reach out to me to say hi!.",
